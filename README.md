# Pokedex SPA

This is an example project to get to grips with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Stack

- [Vue 3 (TS)](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Info

This will be a test project to get me back into using Vue, more specifically Vue 3. This will also be used to broaden my own Design, UI and UX skills to see what I can do.

I shall be making the most of the Vue 3 + Fetch API to query and pull data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## More to come soon
